## Hi,
I am sharing what I learn on my blog **[andtomorrow.craft.me](https://andtomorrow.craft.me)** concerning web development. 
You will find:
 - parts of official documentation explained in Korean language
 - some tech article translations
 - some of (responsive) web layout trials made up with well-known poetic works.
 - snapshots of coffee, etc.

Please visit and _share your thoughts_ by adding comments.
