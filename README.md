## Hi,
I am sharing what I learn on my [craft blog](https://www.craft.do/s/XUSqE9unZVgfAx) concerning web development. 
#### You will find:
 - parts of official documentation with explanation in Korean
 - some tech article translations
 - some of my web (responsive) layout trials made up with poetic works.
 - snapshots of coffee, etc.
#### Please visit and share your thoughts. Any comment will be appreciated.
